# 📊 M5 Forecast Accuracy + AI Audit Simulation

**Part of the AI Clarity Project**  
🟡 *"Illuminating AI. Clarifying Risk."*

---

## 📌 Overview

This project evaluates and audits a machine learning model trained on the [M5 Forecasting Accuracy dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy) to simulate an explainability-driven audit of algorithmic decision-making (ADM).

It uses SHAP, LIME, and DiCE to:
- 📈 Explain model behavior and sales forecasts
- 📎 Validate traceability from input to output
- ⚖️ Align model behavior with AI governance expectations

This structure is designed to reflect real-world audit conditions and is aligned to responsible AI frameworks including the **NIST AI Risk Management Framework**, **EU AI Act**, and internal control standards.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Evaluate forecast accuracy across multiple locations and departments
- ✅ Apply **explainable AI (XAI)** tools to generate interpretable insights
- ✅ Document audit trails, governance alignment, and risk logs
- ✅ Showcase algorithmic transparency and model accountability

## 🧠 XAI Methods Used

- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**  
  Explains feature contributions at the global and instance level

- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**  
  Generates simplified surrogate models to explain individual predictions

- **DiCE (Diverse Counterfactual Explanations)**  
  Produces actionable counterfactuals to test ADM robustness and fairness

---

## 🧾 Governance Features

- 📘 `audit_trace_log.md` — End-to-end traceability from input to ADM decision  
- 📋 `risk_log.md` — Identified risks across compliance, operational, and reputational domains  
- 📄 `model_card.md` — Documentation of model purpose, performance, and ethical considerations  
- 📊 `docs/` — Mapped to NIST AI RMF and EU AI Act standards

---

## 💼 Business Relevance

The structure and outputs simulate what a real business or audit function would expect in:
- SOX ITGC reviews for ML-driven forecasts
- AI Explainability audits for ADM systems
- Algorithmic accountability reporting
